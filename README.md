## Project Summary & Key Findings üìä

### Top Three Positive Employees
Based on the highest monthly sentiment scores, these employees consistently demonstrated positive communication.
- **sally.beck@enron.com**
- **john.arnold@enron.com**
- **patti.thompson@enron.com**

### Top Three Negative Employees
Based on the lowest (most negative) monthly sentiment scores, these employees showed the most negative communication.
- **eric.bass@enron.com**
- **don.baughman@enron.com**
- **kayne.coulter@enron.com**

### List of Employees Flagged as Flight Risks
An employee is flagged as a flight risk if they sent **4 or more negative emails in a rolling 30-day period**. The analysis identified the following employees:
- **eric.bass@enron.com**
- **rhonda.denton@enron.com**

### Key Insights and Recommendations
* **Insight 1: Overall Sentiment is Healthy.** The majority of communications are neutral or positive, which is expected in a professional setting. There is no evidence of widespread negative morale.
* **Insight 2: Negativity is Concentrated.** Negative sentiment is not widespread but is concentrated among a few specific individuals. This suggests that any issues may be localized rather than systemic.
* **Recommendation:** It is recommended that HR or management review the individuals identified in the **"Top Negative"** and **"Flight Risk"** categories. A supportive check-in could help identify and address potential root causes like high stress, workload, or interpersonal conflicts, ultimately improving employee retention.
